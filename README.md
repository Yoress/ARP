# ARP
Aion Reconstruction Project

This repository is a heavily edited fork of the Aion-Core-v4.7.5 that was leaked by GiGatR00n; I don't know who the original authors were.

It has long been my plan to keep this code open source, but my inexperience with git, and a general team culture to keep things close to the vest have prevented me from doing so until now.

I don't mind if you use parts of it for your own project, but be mindful of the license. I'd ask that you give credit where it's due, but from what I've seen among the Aion development community... I won't hold my breath.

To see a mostly updated list of differences between the initial commit and the leak I started with, check the changelog. The changelog will not be maintained going further, as git is more than capable. The main features that stand out are pathfinding via triangle-based navmeshes, and the Mechanics System.

Due to the nature of the Aion Reconstruction Project, some of the static data for this server has been altered in a way that is not retail-like; the data that I have included is not the most up-to-date when compared with the testing server for ARP at the time of writing. I have no intentions of seeking out that data, nor do I currently have any intentions of fixing things that were modified from a retail-like state. If you wish to do so, please reference the data from the leak by GiGatR00n.

I have not included my custom tools for parsing/viewing geodata, creating/viewing navmeshes, or parsing data from the client/other sources; my tools are my own for now, and I don't plan on releasing them (for various reasons). It is my belief that -- because this server is still quite broken -- if you plan to adopt/use this codebase you should have the ability to further develop it -- in such a case, you would also have the ability to create the tools I have not included.

I have also not included the geo/nav data with my initial commit. This was more due to filesize restrictions paired with my incredibly poor upload bandwidth, but as a side-effect it raises the entry level of adopting this codebase in a way befitting of my beliefs.

I have not decided if I will continue to develop this codebase any further as it is.

# Who am I?
I am the former Aion Reconstruction Project developer "Yoress" aka Yon#7259 on Discord.

I decided to amicably part ways with my former team due to the leader of said team being too easily influenced by the playerbase of our public testing server.

I left the following message as I parted ways, and I feel it is an adequate explanation:

"I think it's only fair that we are transparent with those of you here that have interest. With this as one of my core ideals, I feel compelled to announce this to everyone.

Some internal discussions about the direction this team will proceed have left me at a loss; this has put my motivation, and willingness to stay here and continue with this project under question.

Hallien has already left; and now, I must reflect and come to my own decision.

Through the years, I have come to know Twinkle. While she can be a tad difficult sometimes, she's certainly a golden egg of potential; but, as gold usually is, she is malleable. What I originally thought were shared, deep-set ideals, have proven to be flimsy.

I love Aion, and am possessed by the idea of returning it to the world. Similarly, Twinkle loves Aion's setting, and is possessed by the idea of a good game within it. I have zero doubt that Twinkle will continue the struggle to achieve that, even if I take my leave.

I am faced with a difficult decision, however; it's an unfortunate truth that I can continue my dream without Twinkle, whereas she will find maintaining the server here difficult without me.

This project has been an embodiment of my dream: to play the Aion I love again. Twinkle has offered to give me control over the direction this project goes, but I must decline for the same reasons I question my place here. I am far less malleable, and will not let anyone corrupt my dream; nor will I be the one to taint hers.

With that, my journey with this project must sadly come to a close. It was nice meeting you guys, and I hope to keep this parting amicable. Go easy on Twinkle; she's a gal with a dream, and if you support her you may yet still be a part of it."
