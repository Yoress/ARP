/**
 * Generic interface for all enhanced object.<br>
 * <font color="red">NEVER IMPLEMENT THIS CLASS MANUALLY!!!</font> <br>
 * <br>
 * <b>Thread safety, concurrency, deadlocks:</b><br>
 * It's allowed to remove/add listeners from listeners.<br>
 * Listeners are stored in the {@link java.util.concurrent.CopyOnWriteArrayList}, so their behavior is similar.<br>
 * Briefly speaking, if you will try to remove/add a listener from another listener - the current invocation won't be affected, current implementation
 * allocates all listeners that are going to be invoked before execution.<br>
 * <br>
 * {@link Callback#beforeCall(Object, Object[])} and {@link Callback#afterCall(Object, Object[], Object)} are treated as separate invocations, so
 * adding/removing listener in beforeCall will affect afterCall.
